### Hello! My name is Anya Amin and I am an aspiring second-year student at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science and Business Administration. I am seeking a co-op where I can apply the intersection of the concepts that I have learned from both of my majors. I am specifically interested in data analytics and how that can be applied to the real world.
